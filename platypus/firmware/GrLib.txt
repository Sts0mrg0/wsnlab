The MSP430 Graphics Library (GrLib) can be downloaded as part of
MSPWare by Texas Instruments:
	http://www.ti.com/tool/MSPWare
or here:

The internet mentions grlib versions for Stellaris and Tiva-c

Issues:
- draw string functions use char* instead of const char*
- in struct Graphics_Display, the field for height is called heigth 
- usage of global context instead of function argument in
	button.c, checkbox.c, imageButton.c, and radioButton.c
- init functions for offscreen images are declared in grlib.h
	but no implementation is provided (might be part of
	stellaris and tiva-c graphics library)
- grlib.h defines such macros as min/max which causes errors in other headers.
	The following results in errors in stl_vector.h:
	#include <string>
	#include <grlib.h>
	#include <vector>
